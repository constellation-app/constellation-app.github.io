                            <h2>What's new in Constellation v2.6</h2>
                            <p>
                                Here is a list of changes we've added to this
                                version of Constellation v2.6 which are also
                                included in Constellation Cyber v1.5.
                            </p>
                        </header>

                                <h3>New Find View</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								2.6 introduces a fresh new version of the Find 
								View which can be found under Experimental -&gt; 
								Views -&gt; Find, or Ctrl-B for those who like 
								keyboard shortcuts. This comes with all your 
								favourite features from the old version but also 
								has fresh new features as well: 
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									You can now view or replace one result at a 
									time via the <strong>Find Previous</strong> 
									and <strong>Find/Replace Next</strong> 
									buttons. You can still also apply to all 
									results at once if desired.
								</li>									
								<li>
									Instead of the search being applied to just 
									the current graph, you can now choose to 
									optionally apply your search to all open 
									graphs. 
								</li>
								<li>
									On top of adding the results to the current 
									selection, you also have the option to remove 
									the results from the current selection or 
									narrow the search scope to just the current 
									selection.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								The most notable difference compared to the 
								previous version is that this is a JavaFX 
								implementation of the view which means it will 
								have a similar look and feel to most of the other 
								views available in Constellation. It is also 
								undocked by default to make it similar to other 
								applications with a find functionality. The 
								intention is that this new version will 
								eventually replace the old version of the Find 
								View in a future release.  
                            </p>

                            </header>
							<p>
								A description can now be added to the Step tabs 
								located in the Data Access View. This is helpful 
								for identifying the intended purpose of a step. 
								To add a description, simply double-click on the 
								tab you want to edit, type in your description, 
								and then press Enter (or click out of the tab) to 
								set it. Descriptions are also saved with 
								templates so when you load a template, you will 
								get all the existing descriptions with it. 
                            </p>

                            </header>
							<p>
								A helpful improvement has been made to the 
								Quality Control View Category Priority window. 
								When you open the window, if any of the rules 
								have had their severity changed to a level other 
								than the default, the Reset button for that rule 
								will specify the default severity which that rule 
								will be reset to. Note that this change only 
								occurs on loading the window so you won’t see the 
								label on the reset button change while you are 
								changing the severities.
                            </p>

                                <h3>File Importer Improvement</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								A number of useful updates have been made to the 
								File Importer to better handle importing multiple 
								files at the same time. In previous versions, the 
								only restriction on importing multiple files was 
								that the files had to be of the same type (e.g. 
								csv, excel, etc). While only one of the files 
								would display in the preview at any given time, 
								the mapping specified would get applied to all 
								the files added to the list. This caused issues 
								then if the structure of each file was different 
								(e.g. had a different numbers of columns). This 
								issue has been rectified in this release. 
							</p>
							<p>
								When you try add a second file to the file list, 
								if the file you try to add has a different number 
								of columns to first file or has different column 
								headers (if 'Files Include Headers' is selected), 
								a popup will be displayed indicating a mismatch 
								and that file won’t be added to the list. This 
								means you can only import multiple files at the 
								same time if all files have the same column 
								structure.
                            </p>

                            </header>
							<p>
								The Histogram View has also received an update. 
								On top of displaying the total number of bins, 
								the Histogram will now also specify how many of 
								those bins are selected. This makes it easier to 
								analyse the data in your graph when filters are 
								applied.
                            </p>
