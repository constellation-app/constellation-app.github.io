                            <h2>What's new in Constellation v2.11</h2>
                            <p>
                                Here is a list of changes we've added to this
                                version of Constellation v2.11 which are also
                                included in Constellation Cyber v1.10.
                            </p>
                        </header>

                        <section>

                                <h3>Find View Revamped</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								The Find View has finally received its fresh new 
								look. This revamped version of the Find View had 
								previously been available via the Experimental 
								Menu since v2.6 but now that it has stabilised, 
								it has now been moved out of Experimental and 
								officially replaced the old version. This means 
								that the new version now can be accessed via 
								Ctrl-F, as was the case with the old version (no 
								longer Ctrl-B as it was while in Experimental). 
							</p>
							<p>
								If you want to hear about some of the cool 
								features of this revamped version, check out some 
								of the blogs for previous versions which outline 
								in detail some of the notable features and other 
								improvements that were brought in as part of the 
								revamp. 
							</p>
                        </section>

                                <h3>Attribute Editor Updates</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								The Attribute Editor has received a couple of 
								notable updates.
							</p>
							<p>
								The first of these is the ability to hide 
								attributes with no values. One thing you may have 
								noticed if you have used the Attribute Editor 
								previously is that if you have enough attributes 
								added on the graph, the list of attributes gets 
								bloated, and it can be difficult to analyse the 
								values associated with each of those attributes. 
								This gets even more difficult if a number of 
								those attributes don’t contain any value for the 
								given selection. 
							</p>
							<p>
								With this new feature, it will be easier to 
								analyse your data by decluttering the view of any 
								attributes that contain no value. To enable, 
								simply deselect the new “Show Empty” button in 
								the relevant graph element panel. The number of 
								attributes that are hidden is then displayed at 
								the top of graph element panel so that you’re 
								aware that those attributes are still there (just 
								not displayed). Which attributes have no value 
								depends on the graph selection, so an attribute 
								may be hidden for one graph selection and visible 
								in another.  
                            </p>
							<p>
								Of course, if you would prefer to always see all 
								the attributes (as has been the case previously), 
								then simply select “Show Empty” in the relevant 
								graph element panel (it is selected by default). 
							</p>
							<img src="../images/blogs/whats-new-in-constellation-v2.11.0/attribute_editor_hide_empty.png" alt="Attrbibute Editor Hide Empty Attributes" class="image"/>
							<p>
								The second notable update is that the explicit 
								Edit buttons previously found next to each 
								attribute have been removed. Some time ago, 
								Constellation enabled the ability to update 
								attribute values by clicking on the value itself 
								and at that point, the Edit buttons became 
								redundant. The Edit buttons had been kept in 
								after that to enable a transition period, but it 
								was finally determined that now was the time for 
								them to be removed. 
							</p>

                                <h3>Markdown Support in Notes View</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								The Notes View received several additions in the 
								last version of Constellation and in 2.11, we’ve 
								added another. 
							</p>
							<p>
								If you’ve ever wanted to add more expressiveness 
								to your user notes, you can now apply Markdown 
								formatting to your notes. By ticking the Markdown 
								checkbox found in either the Create Note or Edit 
								Note dialogs, the text that you write will be 
								interpreted as having Markdown formatting and 
								will display accordingly. This allows adding 
								things such as headers, bold text, and lists in a 
								much easier way. 
							</p>
							<p>
								If you’re unsure how to apply Markdown formatting 
								to your notes, the Notes View help page has been 
								updated with some examples so you should check 
								that out. You can also use the Preview tab of the 
								relevant dialog to see what it will look like. 
								If you would prefer not apply Markdown formatting 
								to your notes, you can simply leave the checkbox 
								unticked and your note will display as it always 
								has. 
                            </p>

                                <h3>Select All and Clear All Options for Multi-Choice Dropdowns</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								Multi choice menus have been present in 
								Constellation for a long while but one thing they 
								haven’t had are quick ways to select and clear 
								lots of options at once. This means that users 
								must go through and (un)tick all the options they 
								want manually which can get very tedious the 
								longer the list of options is. 
							</p>
							<p>
								This has finally changed though, allowing users 
								to quickly Select All or Clear All options. 
								Simply right-click on the multi-choice dropdown 
								to bring up a menu which will present either 
								option to do. For plugin parameters (such as 
								those found in Data Access View or Analytic 
								View), you can also access these options via a 
								dropdown conveniently located next to the 
								multi-choice dropdown. 
                            </p>

                            </header>
							<p>
								Constellation v2.7 introduced the ability to hide 
								Data Access Plugin categories via Preferences 
								(Options -> CONSTELLATION -> Data Access View). 
								In Constellation v2.11, this preference has been 
								updated to also enable re-ordering of the 
								categories in the visible list. To do so, click 
								on a category in the visible list and then press 
								the up and down arrow buttons to move the 
								category up and down the list. After saving those 
								changes and restarting Constellation, you should 
								see the category order in Data Access View 
								reflect the order you set in Preferences.

                                <h3>An update to the Constellation Client</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								For the first time in a long time, the 
								Constellation Client has received an update. For 
								those not familiar with it, the client is the 
								library which enables using Constellation via a 
								script (e.g. In Scripting View, Jupyter Notebook).      
							</p>
							<p>
								In this update, you now can rename graphs, and 
								this has been done a couple ways. Firstly, there 
								is a new function “rename_graph” in which you 
								pass as parameters the new name for the graph and 
								optionally the graph you want to rename (if you 
								don’t specify one it will rename the active 
								graph). The other way is through the existing 
								“new_graph” function which now allows an optional 
								parameter to specify a name for the graph (if you 
								don’t like the default naming convention which 
								will be applied otherwise).

								Numerous bug fixes have also been made. These 
								include:

								<li>
									Auto Notes are removed from the Notes View if 
									an action is undone
								</li>
								<li>
									Analytic View now remembers the results of 
									the last analytic run after closing and 
									re-opening the view
								</li>
								<li>
									Analytic View also now removes the effects of 
									toggles (Color, Hide, Size) after the view is 
									closed 
								</li>
