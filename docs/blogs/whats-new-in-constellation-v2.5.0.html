                            <p>
                                Here is a list of changes we've added to this
                                version of Constellation v2.5 which are also
                                included in Constellation Cyber v1.4.
                            </p>
                        </header>

                            <p>
                                The biggest change introduced in 2.5 is an 
								overhaul of the help page system. On top of a 
								fresh new look, you now have the option to either 
								view the help pages online or offline. This 
								option can be toggled via Setup -&gt; Options 
								-&gt; Constellation -&gt; Help. With online 
								selected, the application will link to the 
								documentation that is now available on the 
								Constellation website (under 
								<strong>Documentation</strong>).

                            </header>
                            <p>
                                The graph window now has a new selection tool. 
								The current rectangular selection has its 
								limitations, but the new freeform selection will 
								allow more flexibility when selecting graph 
								elements.
                            </p>
							<p>
								To make a freeform selection, hold down the Alt 
								key while the left mouse button is held down and 
								drag your mouse around all the parts of your 
								graph you want to select.

                            </header>
                            <p>
                                Having previously been introduced in 2.4, the 
								search feature of the Conversation View has been 
								updated for 2.5. The view now scrolls to the 
								message that matches a search term. You can use 
								the <strong>Previous</strong> and 
								<strong>Next</strong> buttons located next to the 
								search bar to go to the previous and next match 
								respectively.
                            </p>

                            </header>
                            <p>
                                The Histogram has a couple of notable new 
								features. Firstly, the state of the histogram is 
								saved for each graph element (Node, Transaction, 
								Edge, Link). This means when you switch to a 
								different graph element and then switch back, the 
								histogram will remember what categories and 
								properties were previously selected for that 
								graph element type.
                            </p>
							<p>
								The second new feature available is the ability 
								to numerically sort the bins by labels. 
								Previously, sorting by labels could only be done 
								lexicographically.

                                <h3>Visual Improvements to some Views</h3>
                            </header>
                            <p>
                                Some quality-of-life improvements have been added 
								to several views and importers including the Data 
								Access View, Notes View, Import from File and 
								Import from Database.
                            </p>
                            <p>
								For the Data Access View, the Options menu item 
								has been renamed to 
								<strong>Workflow Options</strong> which better 
								reflects the options it holds. The quality 
								category and the Go button can also now be found 
								at the bottom of the view (as well as the top) 
								for those preferring a more natural workflow 
								going down the view.
                            </p>
							<img src="../images/blogs/whats-new-in-constellation-v2.5.0/data_access.png" alt="Data Access View Visual Improvements" class="image"/>
							
							<p>
								For Notes View, user notes have received an 
								update with all the editing for the note done 
								inline, rather than opening up a separate window 
								to make the relevant edits.
							</p>
							<p>
								For Import from File and Database, some changes 
								have been made to make navigating the importer 
								workflow clearer, as well as, make other parts 
								more visible than they were previously.
							</p>
							<img src="../images/blogs/whats-new-in-constellation-v2.5.0/file_importer.png" alt="Import From File visual improvements" class="image"/>
							
							<p>
								For the Import from Database, there are also some 
								updates to the Manage connections window to make 
								workflows clearer and provide better feedback 
								when something is missing or incorrect.

                            <p>
                                A new experimental feature has also been added to 
								present an anaglyph 3D display of the graph. This 
								allows you to view your graph through an old pair 
								of 3D glasses (the ones with coloured lenses). 
								Simply go Experimental -&gt; Display -&gt; 
								Anaglyphic to update the graph display. You can 
								choose which colour will go through each eye via 
								Setup -&gt; Options -&gt; Constellation -&gt; 
								Anaglyphic Display.

								<h3>Handy Reset Script</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								The installation files now include a Reset script 
								which is useful for existing users of 
								Constellation to clear the local cache between 
								versions. This will make new features more 
								visible.
