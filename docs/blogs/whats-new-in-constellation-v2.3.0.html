                            <h2>What's new in Constellation v2.3</h2>
                            <p>
                                Here is a list of changes we've added to this 
                                version of Constellation v2.3 which are also
                                included in Constellation Cyber v1.2.
                            </p>
                        </header>

                                <h3>Welcome Page</h3>
                            </header>
                            <p>
                                A new default landing page called the "Welcome 
                                Page" is loaded by default with helpful links 
                                for getting started with Constellation. The old 
                                tutorial page you may be familiar with has been 
                                converted into a What's New page to display 
                                updates to Constellation. You can access this 
                                from the menu options on the left hand side.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There is also a preview of graphs that will 
                                appear under the "Recent" section allowing you 
                                to quickly access your old graphs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The motivation for the "Welcome Page" is to 
                                improve the User eXperience (UX) for new 
                                starters. Many thanks to those that contributed
                                to the UX review and design of this Welcome page.
                            </p>

                                <h3>Notes View</h3>
                            </header>
                            <p>
                                This is the first look of the new "Notes View" 
                                which is currently available from the experimental 
                                menu, given this is still the Minimal Viable 
                                Product (MVP) release.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Notes View can be used to add notes about 
                                a graph. It can be found in "Experimental &gt; 
                                Views &gt; Notes View", or alternatively via the 
                                shortcut "Ctrl+Shift+A".
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There are two types of notes that are recorded 
                                in the Notes View:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    User Notes: These are "purple" and are 
                                    created by a user by typing in the tile and 
                                    description and clicking the "Add Note" 
                                    button at the bottom of the view. They may 
                                    also be edited or deleted later via the 
                                    buttons on the note itself.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Auto Notes: These are "blue" and are generated 
                                    and added to the graph automatically by 
                                    plugin execution, similar to the Plugin Reporter.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                We are keen for feedback and suggestions for 
                                improvements so that we can promote this to the 
                                Views menu.

                            </header>
                            <p>
                                In the Constellation settings, a tab has been 
                                added to set the default font family and font 
                                size for all of the views in Constellation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The setting requires a restart of Constellation 
                                for it to be applied and the setting can be 
                                found via Setup &gt; Options &gt; Constellation 
                                &gt; Application Font.

                                <h3>JDBC Importer</h3>
                            </header>
                            <p>
                                The JDBC Importer has been reworked to support 
                                MYSQL, MariaDB and SQLite databases to name a 
                                few. The look and feel of the importer has been 
                                ported over to closely resemble the Delimited 
                                File Importer which we think makes the JDBC 
                                Importer easier to use.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Note that you will need to download the JDBC 
                                connector yourself as we are unable to bundle it 
                                with Constellation at this time. For example you 
                                can get a copy of the MySQL JDBC driver from 
                                <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java">this site</a> 
                                or SQLite JDBC driver from <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.xerial/sqlite-jdbc">this site</a>. 
                                Follow the instructions on the JDBC Importer 
                                help page to how you have to add the connection.
                            </p>

                                The blaze menus have been updated to show preset 
                                blaze colors. An option to save a custom color 
                                as a preset is represented by a checkbox in the 
                                color dialog.
                            </p>

                                The blaze toolbar menu now displays up to 10 
                                preset colors. It now has the ability to change 
                                the color stored by clicking the tile to load a 
                                color picker.

                                Constellation &gt; Graph now stores preset 
                                blaze colors. These can be edited via the color 
                                picker upon clicking the colored tile.

                                Nodes can now be pinned, either through the 
                                pin/unpin toolbar icons in the arrangements panel, 
                                or via the corresponding Arrange menu options. 
                                Once pinned, nodes do not move when arrangement 
                                plugins are run, but can be manually moved. The 
                                "pinned" node attribute stores this information.

                                We've been working hard to make Constellation 
                                more stable and able to cope with larger graphs 
                                on the same hardware. We have reduced the memory 
                                footprint by using caching techniques and other 
                                optimisations so you should see that your graphs 
                                respond quicker as you interact with it, like 
                                deleting nodes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the previous release we experimented with 
                                aggressive performance improvements but we 
                                found this was negatively impacting older 
                                hardware. We think we have found the balance now. 
                                Please upgrade to this version as soon as 
                                possible to take advantage of these performance 
                                improvements.
                            </p>
