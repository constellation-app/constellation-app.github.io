                            <p>
                                Here is a list of changes we've added to this
                                version of Constellation v2.4 which are also
                                included in Constellation Cyber v1.3.

                                <h3>Visualise large datasets in a few mouse clicks!</h3>
                            </header>
                            <p>
                                Building a graph from scratch is a time consuming
                                and fiddly process. The quickest way to set up a
                                graph is to import datasets from a file and
                                Constellation supports numerous file types such
                                as CSV, Excel, XML and JSON. The
                                <b>Import from Delimited File</b> menu option
                                has been renamed to <b>Import from File</b> to
                                better reflect all the different file types that
                                can be handled.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The import process has been streamlined to make
                                it easier to use. Better error handling has been
                                added and it's now easier to delete files if you
                                make a mistake or longer want to import them.
                                Searching for data or graph attributes during the
                                import has been made more obvious, which is handy
                                if you are working with extremely large datasets.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The same improvements have been made to the
                                <b>Import from Database</b> functionality
                                (previously labelled Import from JDBC).

                                We've listened to user feedback and changed the
                                default font colour for graph labels to white to
                                make them easier to read.

                                <h3>Notes View</h3>
                            </header>
                            <p>
                                Do you want to keep track of what actions have
                                been performed on a graph or what type of
                                analysis has been done? The Notes view has been
                                moved out of the Experimental into the main
                                Views menu. You can use this for adding comments
                                to individual nodes or transactions or a group,
                                or the entire graph. This is an easy way to add
                                important information to your graph. Notes are
                                saved directly to the graph and can be viewed by
                                other people if the graph is shared with them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The notes view also has the capability to display
                                and track auto notes which are generated
                                automatically when an action is performed on a
                                graph, such as a plugin being run. There are
                                some handy filtering options so you can focus on
                                the auto notes you are most interested in.
                            </p>

                                The conversation view is a powerful way of
                                analysing content associated with transactions
                                on graphs. You can now search the conversation
                                view for keywords or phrases, and you can see a
                                count for how many times they appear in the text.
                                You can also search the translations too.

                                been updated to match commonly seen category
                                names and colours. The category names now are:

                                have been refined to be easier to read and
                                improved aesthetics such as adding spacing
                                between parameters and bolding text.

                                Release 2.4 includes numerous bug fixes such as:
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Update to the Missing Type Quality Control Rule to flag blank types</li>
                                <li>Fix to conversation view for unexpected locking</li>
                                <li>Enabling type-based layers in the Layers view (currently located under Experimental)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                We have also fixed the bug with remembering the
                                last file location for opening and saving files,
                                so it's easier to work with files in your
                                current directory.

                                To improve performance the "getting started"
                                script in the scripting view has been tweaked to
                                make it more efficient for large graphs. Code
                                dependencies have been updated to the latest
                                versions for maximum performance (geotools,
                                apache-poi, jackson, controlsfx).
