                            <h2>What's new in Constellation v2.10</h2>
                            <p>
                                Here is a list of changes we've added to this
                                version of Constellation v2.10 which are also
                                included in Constellation Cyber v1.9.
                            </p>
                        </header>

                                <h3>New Features and Improvements to Notes View</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								Notes View has been updated with new features and 
								a new look! 
							</p>
							<p>
								Firstly, you can now customise the colour of your 
								user notes. This will allow you to distinguish 
								different notes for different situations. 
								Different colours could be used for different 
								parts of your graph, different stages in your 
								analysis, or perhaps different kinds of notes 
								(e.g. general remarks, notes for future, 
								questions to answer) 
							</p>
							<p>
								Secondly, a datetime filter has been added. This 
								gives you another way to filter notes by only 
								displaying notes that were created during a 
								selected time frame.
							</p>
							<p>
								Lastly, the Notes View interface has been updated 
								to optimise the way notes are displayed. This has 
								been primarily achieved by moving the section to 
								create new notes into a dialog box which pops up 
								when you click the Create Note button. Also for 
								notes that are more than five lines long, notes 
								are contracted with a show more button to expand 
								the note (and a show less button to contract 
								again). These together allow more space to view 
								more notes with less scrolling required.

                                <h3>New Error Report View</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								Previously in Constellation, an error would pop 
								up any time something went wrong. In some 
								instances though, this could result in multiple 
								pops up being displayed at the same time which 
								could be a pain to remove and potentially slow 
								down your computer. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Introducing the Error Report View: a view to help 
								better manage how errors are displayed in 
								Constellation. It can be accessed via Help -> 
								Error Report. In the view, you choose which level 
								of errors you want to popup as well as display 
								reports for. Errors which occur more than once 
								will display a count alongside the existing error 
								rather than displaying a popup for each instance 
								which will significantly decrease the number of 
								errors displayed. You also have the option to 
								stop displaying specific errors when they pop up 
								altogether if you so desire. Altogether, the view 
								should make for a better experience when errors 
								occur.  
                            </p>

                                <h3>New Find View Dropdowns Improved</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								The Current Selection dropdown in the new Find 
								View was a little confusing. Some options 
								suggested what to do for the search itself while 
								others pointed to actions that occur after the 
								search. To remove this confusion, weâ€™ve replaced 
								the Current Selection dropdown with two 
								dropdowns: Search In, and Post-Search Action.
							</p>
							<p>
								With the Search In dropdown, you can choose the 
								scope of your search with options of either the 
								current graph, current selection, or all open 
								graphs (which has moved from its previous 
								location as a checkbox at the bottom of the view).
							</p>
							<p>
								The Post-Search Action dropdown allows you to 
								determine what to do with the results after the 
								search has completed with options to either 
								replace, add to, or remove from the current 
								selection. To compliment this dropdown, there is 
								also now a button at the bottom of the view to 
								delete the results from the graph (or graphs if 
								searching all open ones). 
                            </p>

                                <h3>Plugin Reporter now displays Child Plugins</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								Some plugins in Constellation are made up of 
								several child plugins which will execute in 
								sequence. Previously though, these plugins would 
								display the main parent plugin and its status on 
								its own in the Plugin Reporter. This meant that 
								if the plugin failed, there was no way of telling 
								from the Plugin Reporter which child plugin the 
								error occurred in (as it would simply tell you 
								the parent plugin had failed). The child plugins 
								would have a report displayed as well, but they 
								were presented on the same level as the parent 
								and so there was no apparent connection between 
								parent and child.
							</p>
							<p>
								This has changed now in v2.10 with the reports 
								for child plugins being displayed under the 
								parent plugin that it was executed under. This 
								means you can now see how long each individual 
								child plugin takes to run and should any errors 
								occur during execution, you will know exactly 
								which plugin caused the error to occur. 
                            </p>

									Some data access view plugins which were auto 
									selected by default when launching the view

									Recent graphs on the Welcome Page are no 
									longer occasionally missing 
								</li>
