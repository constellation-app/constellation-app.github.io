                            <h2>What's new in Constellation v3.0</h2>
                            <p>
                                Here is a (sizeable) list of changes we’ve added 
								to this version of Constellation.
                            </p>
                        </header>

                        <section>
                            <header>
                                <h3>All-New Dark and Light Modes + New Menu Icons</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								One of the visual standout features added that 
								you will notice as soon as you load the 
								application is the new dark and light modes. For 
								a long time, Constellation has had a mixture of 
								both light and dark color schemes scattered 
								throughout the application. With the release of 
								v3 though, we’ve now consolidated those schemes 
								into separate light and dark feels. Alongside 
								that, the icons used in menu options throughout 
								the application have also been updated to ensure 
								visibility in either mode.
							</p>
							<p>
								By default, Constellation will run in dark mode. 
								This can be changed though via the Options Menu. 
								Simply go to Setup -> Options -> Appearance -> 
								Look and Feel and choose your preferred look and 
								feel. Any look and feel with “Dark” in the name 
								will load with the dark scheme, and all others 
								will load with the light scheme. We personally 
								recommend using either FlatLaf Dark (the default) 
								or FlatLaf Light (if you prefer light mode) as 
								these were the look and feels used when putting 
								together the color schemes, but feel free to use 
								any of the options available. 
							</p>
							<p>
								One thing to keep in mind is that for graphs 
								themselves, the mode your application is in will 
								only affect the graph’s background color when 
								creating a new graph. New graphs created in dark 
								mode will have the classic Night Sky color, but 
								graphs created in light mode will have the new 
								Light Sky color. Opening existing graphs in 
								either mode will retain the background color that 
								the graph previously had. Note that the 
								background color is a graph attribute and so if 
								you wish to change the background color of your 
								graph, you can do so by editing the 
								background_color attribute via the Attribute 
								Editor.

                                <h3>Colorblind Overlays for your Graph</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								Another big addition to v3 is a big one for 
								accessibility. Previously, Constellation 
								development hasn’t put much consideration into 
								whether the color schemes being used are 
								colorblind-friendly. For v3 though, this is no 
								longer an oversight as we’ve now introduced the 
								option to apply colorblind-friendly overlays to 
								your graph. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Choose a colorblind mode to apply to your graph 
								by navigating to Setup -> Options -> 
								CONSTELLATION -> Application -> Colorblind Mode. 
								Current options include None (i.e. no filter 
								applied, the default), Deuteranopia, Protanopia, 
								and Tritanopia. After choosing, when you next 
								Complete with Schema, your graph will be colored 
								according to the colorblind mode chosen to ensure 
								that the colors on your graph are compliant with 
								the mode selected.  
							</p>
							<p>
								For modes other than None, a new attribute will 
								be added (if it doesn’t already exist) to your 
								nodes and transactions called “colorblind_layer” 
								whose value will either match the value in the 
								color attribute (if the color is compliant), or a 
								newly calculated color (if the color was not 
								compliant). The value in the new attribute is 
								then what you will see on the graph.

                                <h3>Brand New Word Cloud View</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								The newest view available for use in 
								Constellation is the Word Cloud View. Available 
								via the Experimental menu (or Ctrl-Shift-W if you 
								like keyboard shortcuts), the Word Cloud View 
								allows you to generate a word cloud based on a 
								string attribute on your graph. This then enables 
								you to analyse the phrases that appear on your 
								graph and how often those phrases appear. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Word Clouds can be generated based on phrase 
								length, phrase span, and a threshold for the 
								minimum number of times a phrase is found. You 
								can also filter the cloud based on a 
								user-supplied text file of phrases you wish to 
								filter on.  
                            </p>

                                <h3>Export your Graphs to SVG</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								Constellation for a long time has had the ability 
								to save a screenshot of your graph as a PNG file. 
								This has enabled users to embed their 
								(non-interactive) graph into word documents, 
								presentations, and other places to view a graph 
								without needing to load Constellation. A 
								limitation of it though, is that the file type 
								isn’t scalable, meaning attempts to blow up the 
								image can make it pixelated and hard to look at. 
								To help with that issue, we’ve introduced 
								exporting to an SVG file (available from File -> 
								Export -> To SVG...).  
							</p>
							<p>
								For those who aren’t aware, SVG’s are vector 
								images, which in simple terms means that the 
								image will maintain its clarity when being blown 
								up. This means being able to include much clearer 
								images in presentations or anywhere you want to 
								include a view of your graph. Unlike the 
								Screenshot export, the SVG export also gives you 
								more flexibility in choosing which angle to 
								export the graph from (not just the current 
								camera angle), and even which parts of graph get 
								exported. 
							</p>
							<p>
								One caveat to be aware of with the functionality 
								though, is that it is a memory-intensive 
								operation. Because of that, it is recommended 
								that you only use the feature for exporting 
								smaller graphs (it's been noted in environments 
								it was tested in, that the feature encounters 
								memory issues once getting past 50,000 nodes, 
								50,000 transactions).  
                            </p>

                            </header>
							<p>
								A big change to the interface in the Conversation 
								View now sees conversations paginated in a 
								similar way to what is done in the Table View. By 
								doing this, we’re hoping this helps make the view 
								more performant by reducing the strain on the 
								graphics trying to load all the conversation 
								bubbles. Like the Table View, you have the option 
								to choose how many conversations bubbles you want 
								displayed on each page: 50, 100, 250, or 1000.

                                <h3>Constellation Client Fixed</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								Last release, we made our first update to the 
								Python client in a long time. What we discovered 
								out of that though, is that it turns out the 
								client hasn’t really been working as intended for 
								quite some time. The primary reason for this was 
								the .ipython folder (where the client is 
								installed) was no longer by default added to the 
								classpath, which means that users could no longer 
								simply call the client from any folder they so 
								wished. Other issues with the client also 
								surfaced including compatibility with newer 
								Python versions. With all of that to consider, 
								changes had to be made to the client for it get 
								back to functioning as intended. 
							</p>
							<p>
								So for v3, we’ve updated the way that the client 
								is installed. Instead of downloading the client, 
								Constellation now performs a pip install of the 
								client (Note that it is installing a local 
								instance rather than from PyPI). Specifically, it 
								will run a pip install --update, that way you can 
								get the latest changes for the client every time. 
								This will run whenever you launch either Start 
								Jupyter Notebook or Start REST Server (in case 
								you prefer to launch your notebook application 
								separately). 
							</p>
							<p>
								Changes have also been made alongside it to 
								enable compatibility with later versions of 
								Python while also maintaining compatibility with 
								older versions.  
							</p>

                                <h3>Keyboard Shortcuts for Zoom In and Out</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								Constellation has always allowed zooming in and 
								out of a graph using the scroll wheel of your 
								mouse. For those that don’t have access to that 
								though, Constellation now has keyboard shortcuts 
								for these actions. Ctrl- - (including Num Pad) 
								will zoom out and Ctrl- = (and Ctrl- + on Num 
								Pad) will zoom in on your graph.     
							</p>

                            </header>
							<p>
								Over the last couple versions of Constellation, 
								we’ve introduced customisation around which 
								categories of plugins you see (and in which order 
								you see them) in the Data Access View. For v3, 
								we’ve extended this further by adding a reset 
								option. In the preferences menu (Setup -> Options 
								-> CONSTELLATION -> Data Access View), when you 
								click on “Restore to Default”, all the categories 
								will be placed in their default visibility and 
								ordering.

                            </header>
							<p>
								Have you ever wanted a quick way to select all 
								the nodes or all the transactions on your graph, 
								without having to select everything (or manually 
								selecting)? The Selection menu now comes with two 
								new options. “Select Nodes” selects (only) all 
								the nodes, and “Select Transactions” does a 
								similar thing for transactions. These are the 
								inverse operations of the existing “Deselect 
								Nodes” and “Deselect Transactions”.

                                <h3>Attribute Editor Update</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								A minor update has been made to the Attribute 
								Editor in order improve the experience around 
								editing values for attributes. Previously, if a 
								graph element had no value for an attribute and 
								you wished to edit the value, you would first 
								have to untick the “No Value” checkbox before 
								proceeding to alter the value. Assuming though 
								that you intend to edit the value when you bring 
								up the edit dialog, unticking the checkbox 
								presents as an extra step you would rather not 
								have to do or even think about. 
							</p>
							<p>
								For v3, we’ve removed this step so that the No 
								Value checkbox is always unticked when you enter 
								the edit dialog. This allows you to get straight 
								into editing the value as desired. If you wish 
								the set the value to No Value, the checkbox is 
								still there for you to check. If you wish to 
								retain the No Value you had, you can simply close 
								the dialog box (or press Cancel).

                            </header>
							<p>
								The Find View has a new feature which enables you 
								to zoom to your search results. By ticking the 
								“Zoom to Selection” checkbox, when you go through 
								your results (e.g. with Find All or Find 
								Next/Previous), Constellation will put the 
								results in focus in the Graph window. If you’re 
								someone who has gotten frustrated at not being 
								able to find where all the search results are on 
								your graph, this is the feature for you.

                                <h3>Layers View Update</h3>
                            </header>
							<p>
								The Layers View has received an update to the 
								logic for determining what is visible on the 
								graph according to the layers selected. 
								Previously, the logic was a little messy and 
								differed depending on whether the graph elements 
								in the selected layers were determined by query 
								or by manual addition. This in turn led to a lot 
								of confusion surrounding what you expected to see 
								when you had multiple layers selected. To fix 
								this, the logic has been cleaned up and put in 
								your hands to determine by introducing two modes: 
								Union and Intersection. 
							</p>
							<p>
								When multiple layers are selected in Union Mode, 
								any graph element that belongs to any of the 
								selected layers will be visible. For example, if 
								layer 1 contains nodes 1 and 2, and layer 2 
								contains nodes 2 and 3, then having layers 1 and 
								2 selected would see all of nodes 1, 2, and 3 
								visible. 
							</p>
							<p>
								When multiple layers are selected in Intersection 
								Mode, only graph elements that belong to all the 
								selected layers will be visible. For example, if 
								layer 1 contains nodes 1 and 2, and layer 2 
								contains nodes 2 and 3, then having layers 1 and 
								2 selected would see only node 2 visible.
