      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Notes View allows you to annotate on your graph. This is useful for remembering important pieces of information, and keeping track of what plugins have been run.</p>
      <div style="text-align: center">

      <p><img src="../ext/docs/CoreNotesView/src/au/gov/asd/tac/constellation/views/notes/resources/NotesView.png" alt="Notes
      View" /></p>
      </div>

      <p>There are two kinds of notes that can be added to the Notes View:</p>
      <h2>User-Generated Notes</h2>
      <p>These are notes which are created by a user and are colored purple by default. These notes are generated by clicking on the "Create Note" button on the top left and filling the title and note fields located in the pop-up window that appears. Both of these fields need to be filled in otherwise a message will pop-up prompting you to fill in both fields. There is a colour picker where the user can pick what colour the note should be. If you have the "Link note to graph selection" option enabled, the note will be applied to all the nodes and transactions that are selected on the graph (a count of how many of each will be displayed on the note). If the option is not enabled, or there is nothing selected on the graph, the note is applied to the entire graph. Notes will be a default height and will have a "Show More" button if the contents of the note exceed the height.</p>
      <p>Once added, these notes can edited by pressing the "Edit" button on the note. A note can be deleted by pressing the "Delete" button on the note.</p>
      <p>You can see which nodes and transactions a user-generated note is linked to by right-clicking on a note and pressing "Select on Graph". This will change the graph selection to only the nodes and transactions linked to that note. To change the selection linked to the note, make a selection on the graph, right-click on the note, and then select either "Add Selected" to link all of the selected nodes and transactions to the note or "Removed Selected" to unlink any part of the selection already linked to the note.</p>
      <h2>Auto-Generated Notes</h2>
      <p>These are notes which are created by Constellation and are colored blue. These notes are generated when plugins are executed. Unlike user generated notes, these notes cannot be edited or removed.</p>
      <p>NOTE: Auto generated notes are always created in the background but they won't be added to the Notes View unless the view is open. If you close Constellation before it has a chance to add those notes to the Notes View, those notes will be lost.</p>
      <h2>Filters</h2>
      <p>There are filters available to determine what notes are visible in the view:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><em>User Notes</em>: Show all the user-generated notes.</li>
      <li><em>Auto Notes</em>: Show all the auto-generated notes. When this is ticked, an additional filter drop-down is added, allowing you to filter on specific types of plugins.</li>
      <li><em>Selected</em>: Show all the user-generated notes for a given selection (including those applied to the entire graph). When this is ticked, the User Notes and Auto Notes options are automatically unticked (if any of them are ticked). Similarly, if you tick one of the other filter options, this option will be automatically unticked.</li>
      <li><em>Time range filter</em>: A time range filter that allows the user to only<br />
      display notes in a specific time range. Times can be changed to different time zones.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Markdown Support</h2>
      <p>The Notes View supports some Markdown text now. There is a checkbox in the new note window that allows you to enable and disable Markdown. Markdown is a markup language for creating formatted text. As of now the notes view supports Markdown features like:</p>
      <pre><code>1. Headings
          Put the 1-6 # characters and a space before text to create a heading.
          The higher the number os #s the smaller the heading.
      2. Italics
          You can write italic text by surrounding text with (_) or (*). For example _Italic text_ or *Italic text*.
      3. Bold
          You can have bold text by surrounding text with (__) or (**). For example **Bold text** or __Bold text__.
      4. Strikethrough
          You can have Strikethrough text by surrounding text with (~~). For example ~~Strikethrough text~~.
      5. Lists
          You can have ordered lists. Lists must start with &quot;1.&quot; and space before the item text then every consequent list item must have a number
          and dot before it to be included in the list. Sublists can also be made, simply make a list item and then in the line under it press tab
          so that indentation is one more than the parent list item and then write (1. ) to start a new list. Every list item with the same indentation
          as the first sublist item will be included as part of the sublist.
          List example
              1. List item 1
              2. List item 2
                  1. Sublist item 1
                  2. Notice how sublist starts the same way as regular list just indented
                      1. Sub-sub list
              3. List item 3
